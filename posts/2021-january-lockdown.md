## COVID-19 Lockdown

The Ontario government has decided to lockdown Ontario from December 26, 2020 for at least 28 subsequent days (January 25, 2020). Here is the exact reasoning provided by the government as justification for this lockdown:

> A provincewide shutdown will help interrupt or slow current community transmission, reduce mobility and allow our health care and public health systems that are reaching critical limits and to recover briefly and catch-up.

## Impact on 2381

All 2381 teams are from Ottawa, Ontario. As a result of this lockdown, no two member will be able to meet under one roof. Consequently, we will not be able to participate in upcoming evens. Unfortunately, this means that 2381C will no longer be able to defend their #1 Robot Skills ranking (with a 250 score as of 19 December 2020).
