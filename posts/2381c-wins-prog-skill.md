Because of the advent of COVID-19, teams here at 2381 are currently working and competing from home. Due to Ontario lockdown regulations, there aren’t any in person tournaments accessible to our organization at the moment, besides virtual and in-person skills competitions which 2381C have been actively participating in. Hence, 2381C spent a large portion of their time during lockdown working on programming the robot in anticipation for programming skills, rising to the challenge of the VRC annotated programming skills online challenge.

On behalf of 2381, we are excited that 2381C has been crowned one of the 3 high school winners for this online challenge, qualifying them directly for the 2021 VEX Robotics WORLDS CHAMPIONSHIP held in Dallas, Texas! The link to 2381C’s submission can be found below:
