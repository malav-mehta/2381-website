The Massey-Vanier VRC Qualifying Event was a great start to the new season. 2381 teams came back after a great performance at Massey Vanier proving themselves to be some of the strongest teams at the tournament. After a great round-robin portion, 2381C formed an alliance with 4862B, 2381W with 20315C (Marcelline Robotics), and 2381Z with 2381Y. 2381W managed to win their way to a spot in the finals, but unfortunately lost in the hard-fought finals. 2381C acquired Excellence, and 2381Z with design securing them both a spot at provincials. Great job everyone!
