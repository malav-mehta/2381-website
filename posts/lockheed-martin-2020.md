Today, 5 2381 teams competed at the Lockheed Martin VEX EDR Qualifying Event in Ottawa. After many well fought matches, all 2381 teams secured a spot in the elimination round. 2381C formed an alliance with 2381Y, 2381A with 2381Z, and 2381D with 4783A. After many great performances from all teams, 2381C and 2381Y managed to get into the semifinal round, unfortunately losing to the alliance which would become tournament champions, 97779A and 11269A. On the bright side, a skills performance placing them 3rd in the competition, 2381Y managed to qualify to provincials. Thank you everyone for your hand work.
